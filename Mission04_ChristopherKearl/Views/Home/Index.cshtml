                            During the Winter 2022 semester, I had a conversation or two with friends that were in the IS Core during that time.
                            They mentioned how well the courses linked together and how the development environment of .NET was comfortable and conveinent.
                            I'm excited to learn C# syntactically and learn more practical applications of web application development in business settings.
